#### Salary Calculation Logic

SalaryComponent is dependent upon base salary and can be calculated as baseSalary multiplied by respective factor. i.e.

       SalaryComponent_amount = baseSalary * factor;

Actual salary can be calculated as sum of all SalaryComponent amounts.

       Salary_amount = Sum of all SalaryComponent_amounts;
